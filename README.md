[![HitCount](https://hits.dwyl.com/notunixian/ExternalLogger.svg?style=flat-square)](http://hits.dwyl.com/notunixian/ExternalLogger)


### Archival Notice
Due to the UI 2.0 Update, they have added checks to block requests to download avatars if you using a proxy.\
This repo serves no use with it non-functional.

If you want to continue logging avatars in some form, consider checking out my [base for vrchat clients within c++](https://github.com/notunixian/simple-base) which contains a hook for avatars, giving you the asset url and such (going to add some stuff to json print it to a file or download it l8r).

It was nice while it lasted.\
